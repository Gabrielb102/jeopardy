Here is my jeopardy project. This project took me a lot longer than I thought it would take purely because I had to identify things through trial and error. Many of the things I'm doing are not yet stuck in my memory, so I would find myself console.logging much of it right as I did it. I also took pride in much of the code, and opted to make it better as I revisited parts of it. For example, in the fill table function, each of the rows were coded out, and I decided to convert them into loops instead. I decided to do that in order to make the code easier to edit and more concise. 

Overall, it was as much a self-learning experience as it was an assessment, and approximately, it took me about 22 hours. The only thing I'm not satisfied with is the issue where the words come in big and then shrink to the size I specified in the css when the clues are clicked. I couldn't find where that was written. 

Thank you, I can't wait to put this to work for my own projects. 

A comment though: I could not have done this project without Promise.all or learning about .then. My knowledge of AJAX wasn't complete until I found those myself and then even later my mentor helped me truly understand AJAX. I really think Promise.all and .then should be taught to reinforce what is learned about AJAX, it would have saved me about 5 hours of fiddling around with async/await.
